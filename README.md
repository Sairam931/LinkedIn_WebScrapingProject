Leveraging LinkedIn Data for Better Personalized Job Matches to Improve Job Recommendations.
Matching the appropriate talent with the right role is difficult in a competitive job market. Employers have a hard time finding applicants that fit their ideal positions while job seekers struggle to locate jobs that match their talents and career objectives. A job recommendation engine driven by LinkedIn is our solution. It analyzes LinkedIn data using machine learning algorithms to produce customized job recommendations. This system learns and adjusts, resulting in an experience that is optimum. It aspires to reinvent job searches by giving individuals access to relevant possibilities and helping businesses find the best prospects. The most important things are strict validation and adherence to LinkedIn's policies.
